## About the Dashboard
This interactive Power BI dashboard is an essential tool for understanding and analyzing historical flight arrival delays across the US. It allows users to quickly explore when, where, and why delays occur by providing a dynamic and comprehensive view of the US aviation system.

## Key Features
- **Overall Median Arrival Delay:** A key performance indicator (KPI) that provides an immediate pulse check on system performance. This metric updates dynamically as you apply filters, giving you an instant overview of delays based on your selections.
- **Date and Airline Filters:** At the top of the dashboard, you can adjust the date range and select specific airlines to focus your analysis on particular time periods or carrier performance.
- **Understanding "When" Delays Occur:**
  - **Median Arrival Delay by Time of Day:** A line chart that plots median delays against six time periods throughout the day. This is crucial for identifying peak hours when delays are most likely to surge.
  - **Median Arrival Delay by Day of Week:** This line chart reveals clear weekly patterns, helping you understand which days consistently experience the most significant delays (e.g., Fridays).

- **Identifying "Where" Delays Cluster:**
  - **Map Visual of Median Arrival Delay per Airport:** This visual helps you identify geographical hotspots of delays. Each bubble on the map represents a major US airport, with its size indicating the median delay relative to the overall system average. Larger bubbles immediately pinpoint areas that require closer attention.
- **Analyzing "Who" is Contributing to Delays:**
  - **Median Arrival Delay per Airline:** A bar chart that ranks airlines by their median arrival delay. The visual includes a yellow vertical line representing the overall median delay, allowing you to easily see which carriers are performing above or below the system's benchmark. When filtered by an airport (e.g., Dallas-Fort Worth), this chart highlights the biggest contributors to delays at that specific location.
- **Understanding the "Why" Behind Delays:**
  - **Delay Reason Breakdown:** This final chart provides a breakdown of delay causes, such as late aircraft, air carrier issues, or other factors. By filtering for a specific airport or airline, you can identify the primary reasons for delays in that context. This helps shift the focus from reactive problem-solving to proactive delay management.

This dashboard is designed to empower users with the ability to swiftly pinpoint and investigate delays, providing a robust, descriptive view of past performance to inform future strategy.
